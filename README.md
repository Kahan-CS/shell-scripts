# 🛠️ Shell Scripts for Automating My CS Chores

## 🚀 How to Run the Scripts
1. **Download** the scripts into a designated folder.
2. **Open** a terminal in that folder.
3. **Execute** the script using the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\name_of_script.ps1 -targetFolder "C:\path\to\your\folder(target)"

## 🔧 In Progress:
- Developing **Bash** versions of the scripts.
- Simplifying execution by creating **.exe** files.
- Designing a **GUI** for direct handling of the executable using Windows Forms or WPF.

## 🌟 Future Goals:
- Creating additional scripts for organizing course folders every semester.
- Custom scripting for improved efficiency in managing coursework and related files.
